# SDL2-Box2D-Starter
This project is just to create a little physics test that showcases how you'd incorporate SDL2 and Box2D together, using the default SDL2 render API.

If you're using a computer with a distribution of linux installed, and you don't want to compile for whatever reason, you can
chmod a+x both "PBS_DEBUG.x86_64" and "PBS.sh" and then run the shell script, and it should just work. Box2D is statically compiled in the binary.
